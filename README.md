This report is written as part of Assignment 1: Predicting Customer Churn in a Subscription-Based Business for Big Data Analytics course. The goal of this project is to examine customer
churn patterns using machine learning techniques, notably Decision Trees and Random Forests. The report details the exploratory data analysis (EDA), model construction, performance
evaluation, and business insights gleaned from the study. We intend to identify significant contributors to customer turnover and recommend solutions to improve customer retention using
statistical summaries, data visualizations, and predictive modelling. This contribution demonstrates a thorough approach to tackling a real-world business problem through data-driven approaches.
